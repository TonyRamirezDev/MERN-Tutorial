Completing a tutorial based around creating a React app using the MERN stack. This was more of an exercise to learn how to fully set up the MERN stack and I am hoping to tackle more React heavy projects in the future. Wanted to get a foundation for the full stack first, which I can then apply to the making of other projects that will be more custom and dependent on my individual coding. The tutorial can be found here:

Also trying to integrate lessons and tutorials regarding git and running from the command line. Not following any specific tutorial, but trying to cover what I have perceived as the main functionality, which includes Pushing, Commiting, Creating the Repo itself, and submitting Pull Requests.
